Welcome to the FractDroidGL project

FractDroidGL is a fractional function opengl renderer for Android, powered by Necessitas Qt.

Install

1, In order to build FractDroidGL, you have to install Necessitas SDK first. Please follow the details in:
http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/necessitas/

2, Connect your device ( Android 2.3.3+ and OpenGL ES 2.0 support required ) to your machine

3, Run ncessitas, open FractDroidGL.pro, click rebuild project.

4, Click run. It should deploy an apk to your device. Have fun.

The amazing thing about using Ncessitas project is that you can open .pro file in a normal QCreator on your PC, build and run a PC version of the app without any modification. So, you can debug the app in your PC just like a regular PC App and deploy to your device if you feel confident or try to test multi-touch function.
